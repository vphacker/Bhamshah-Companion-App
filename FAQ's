The Card is linked to a bank account that is in the name of lady of the house who is the head of the family. The card leverages bio-metric identication and core banking. Multiple cash benets would be accessed through the Bhamashah Card and will be directly transferred to bank accounts of the beneciaries.  Non-cash benets would be given directly to entitled beneciaries."<<endl;
